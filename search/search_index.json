The following are the types of subject matter a practitioner may be engaged to report on using the trust services criteria: </p> <ul> <li>The effectiveness of controls within an entity\u2019s cybersecurity risk management program to achieve the entity\u2019s cybersecurity objectives using the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality as control criteria in a SOC for Cybersecurity examination. </li> <li>The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls included in management\u2019s description of a service organization's system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy throughout a specified period to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives based on those criteria in a type 2 SOC 2 engagement. A type 2 SOC 2 engagement, which includes an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls, also includes a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. A type 1 SOC 2 engagement addresses the same subject matter as a type 2 SOC 2 engagement; however, a type 1 SOC 2 report does not contain an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls nor a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests.</li> <li>The design and operating effectiveness of a service organization\u2019s controls over a system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy in a SOC 3\u00ae engagement. A SOC 3 report contains an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls but does not include a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. </li> <li>The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls of an entity, other than a service organization, over one or more systems relevant to one or more of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy (for example, a SOC for Supply Chain examination). </li> <li>The suitability of the design of an entity\u2019s controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives based on the related trust services criteria.</li> </ul> <p>For example, consider the following engagements: </p> <ul> <li>In a SOC 2 engagement to examine and report on a service organization\u2019s controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system, management is responsible for meeting its commitments to customers. Therefore, the objectives in a SOC 2 engagement relate to meeting its service commitments to customers and system requirements. Service commitments are the declarations made by management to customers regarding the performance of one or more of the entity\u2019s systems. Such commitments generally are included in written contracts, service-level agreements, or public statements (for example, a privacy notice). Some commitments are applicable to all customers (baseline commitments), whereas others are designed to meet individual customer needs and result in the implementation of processes or controls, in addition to those required to meet the baseline commitments. System requirements refer to how the system should function to achieve the entity\u2019s commitments to customers, relevant laws and regulations, guidelines of industry groups such as trade or business associations, or other business objectives. </li> <li>In a SOC for Supply Chain engagement to examine and report on an entity\u2019s controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system used to produce, manufacture, or distribute products, management is responsible for establishing principalsystem objectives. Such objectives are embodied in the product commitments the entity makes to customers, including producing or manufacturing a product that meets product performance specifications and other production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. Commitments may also relate to other matters (for example, conforming with a variety of other standards and criteria such as the risk entity management framework issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the cybersecurity standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Food and Drug Administration regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures included in Code of Federal Regulations, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, Title 21, Part 11). </li> <li>In an entity-wide SOC for Cybersecurity examination, the entity establishes cybersecurity objectives. Cybersecurity objectives are those that could be affected by cybersecurity risk and, therefore, affect the achievement of the entity\u2019s compliance, reporting, and operational objectives. The nature of an entity\u2019s cybersecurity objectives will vary depending on the environment in which the entity operates, the entity\u2019s mission and vision, the overall business objectives established by management, and other factors. For example, a telecommunication entity may have a cybersecurity objective related to the reliable functioning of those aspects of its operations that are deemed to be critical infrastructure, whereas an online dating entity is likely to regard the privacy of the personal information collected from customers to be a critical factor in achieving its operating objectives.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"TrustServicesCategories/","title":"Trust Services Categories","text":""},{"location":"TrustServicesCategories/#defintion","title":"Defintion","text":""},{"location":"TrustServicesCategories/#security","title":"Security.","text":"<p>Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of information, and damage to systems that could compromise the availability, integrity,  confidentiality, and privacy of information or systems and affect the entity\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. </p> <p>Security refers to the protection of </p> <ol> <li>information during its collection or creation, use, processing, transmission, and storage and </li> <li>systems that use electronic information to process, transmit or transfer, and store information to enable the entity to meet its objectives.

Processing integrity addresses whether systems achieve the aim or purpose for which they exist and whether they perform their intended functions in an unimpaired manner, free from error, delay, omission, and unauthorized or inadvertent manipulation. Because of the number of systems used by an entity, processing integrity is usually only addressed at the system or functional level of an entity.

The ability to view personal information held by an organization. This ability may be complemented by an ability to update or correct the information. Access defines the intersection of identity and data, that is, who can do what to which data. Access is one of the fair information practice principles. Individuals need to be able to find out what personal information an entity has on file about them and how the information is being used. Individuals need to be able to correct erroneous information in such records. </li> <li>architecture. The design of the structure of a system, including logical components, and the logical interrelationships of computers, operating systems, networks, or other elements, whether internally or externally hosted. </li> <li>authentication.

The process of obtaining personal information from the individual directly (for example, through the individual\u2019s submission of an internet form or a registration form) or from another party, such as a business partner. </li> <li>commitments. Declarations made by management to customers regarding the performance of one or more systems that provide services or products. Commitments can be communicated in written individualized agreements, standardized contracts, service-level agreements, or published statements (for example, a security practices statement). A commitment may relate to one or more trust services categories. Commitments may be made on many different aspects of the service being provided or the product, production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. </li> <li>component. One of five elements of internal control, including the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. </li> <li>compromise.

An action established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management\u2019s directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. </li> <li>consent. This privacy requirement is one of the fair information practice objectives. Individuals must be able to prevent the collection of their personal data, unless legally required. If an individual has a choice about the use or disclosure of his or her information, consent is the individual\u2019s way of giving permission for the use or disclosure. Consent may be affirmative (for example, opting in) or implied (for example, not opting out). There are two types of consent: <ul> <li>explicit consent. A requirement that an individual \"signifies\" agreement with a data controller by some active communication between the parties. </li> <li>implied consent. When consent may reasonably be inferred from the action or inaction of the individual. </li> </ul> </li> <li>COSO. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
