###  2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus — 2022)


## Purpuse

ASEC has developed a set of criteria (trust services criteria) to be used when evaluating the suitability of 
the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems used to provide products or services, or the confidentiality or privacy 
of information processed by the systems used to provide products or services at an entity, a division, or 
an operating unit of an entity. In addition, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, 
confidentiality or privacy of a particular type of information processed by one or more of an entity’s systems or one or more systems used to support a particular function within the entity. This document presents the trust services criteria

## Scope
The TSC defines criteria to control the risks:
- threaten its ability to achieve its objectives due to external and internal threats to the achievement of those objectives 
- the vulnerabilities of its systems, processes, and procedures. 

Such threats and vulnerabilities arise because of factors such as the following: 
- The nature of the entity’s operations 
- The environment in which it operates 
- The types of information generated, used, or stored by the entity 
- The types of commitments made to customers and other third parties 
- Responsibilities entailed in operating and maintaining the entity’s systems and processes 
- The technologies, connection types, and delivery channels used by the entity 
- The use of third parties (such as service providers and suppliers), who have access to the entity’s 
- system, to provide the entity with critical raw materials or components or operate controls that are necessary, in combination with the entity’s controls, to achieve the system’s objectives 
- Changes to the following: 
   - System operations and related controls 
   - Processing volume 
   - Key management personnel of a business unit, supporting IT, or related personnel 
   - Legal and regulatory requirements with which the entity needs to comply 
- Introduction of new services, products, or technologies
