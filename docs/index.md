##  2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus — 2022)


# Purpuse

ASEC has developed a set of criteria (trust services criteria) to be used when evaluating the suitability of 
the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems used to provide products or services, or the confidentiality or privacy 
of information processed by the systems used to provide products or services at an entity, a division, or 
an operating unit of an entity. In addition, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, 
confidentiality or privacy of a particular type of information processed by one or more of an entity’s systems or one or more systems used to support a particular function within the entity. This document presents the trust services criteria
