# Logical and Physical Access Controls - CC6.2

### Prior to issuing system credentials and granting system access, the entity registers and authorizes new internal and external users whose access is administered by the entity. For those users whose access is administered by the entity, user system credentials are removed when user access is no longer authorized.

    * Reviews Validity of Access Credentials — The entity reviews access credentials on a periodic basis for validity (for example, employees, contractors, vendors, and business partner personnel) and inappropriate system or service accounts.
