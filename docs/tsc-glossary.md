* **access to personal information**. The ability to view personal information held by an organization. This ability may be complemented by an ability to update or correct the information. Access defines the intersection of identity and data, that is, who can do what to which data. Access is one of the fair information practice principles. Individuals need to be able to find out what personal information an entity has on file about them and how the information is being used. Individuals need to be able to correct erroneous information in such records. 
* **architecture**. The design of the structure of a system, including logical components, and the logical interrelationships of computers, operating systems, networks, or other elements, whether internally or externally hosted. 
* **authentication**. The process of verifying the identity or other attributes claimed by or assumed of an entity (user, process, or device) or to verify the source and integrity of data. 
* **authorization**. The process of granting access privileges to a user, program, or process by a person that has the authority to grant such access. 
* **board or board of directors**. Individuals with responsibility for overseeing the strategic direction of the entity and the obligations related to the accountability of the entity.

* **controls**. Policies and procedures that are part of the entity’s system of internal control. The objective of an entity’s system of internal control is to provide reasonable assurance that principal system objectives are achieved. 
* **control activity**. An action established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management’s directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. 
* **consent**. This privacy requirement is one of the fair information practice objectives. Individuals must be able to prevent the collection of their personal data, unless legally required. If an individual has a choice about the use or disclosure of his or her information, consent is the individual’s way of giving permission for the use or disclosure. Consent may be affirmative (for example, opting in) or implied (for example, not opting out). There are two types of consent: 
    - **explicit consent**. A requirement that an individual "signifies" agreement with a data controller by some active communication between the parties. 
    - **implied consent**. When consent may reasonably be inferred from the action or inaction of the individual. 
* **COSO**. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. COSO is a joint initiative of five private-sector organizations and is dedicated to providing thought leadership through the development of frameworks and guidance on enterprise risk management, internal control, and fraud deterrence. (See www.coso.org.) 
* **criteria**. The benchmarks used to measure or evaluate the subject matter.  
* **cybersecurity objectives**. Objectives that address the cybersecurity risks that could affect the achievement of the entity’s overall business objectives (including compliance, reporting, and operational objectives). 
* **data controller**. An organization that (alone or jointly with others) determines the purposes for and the means by which personal data is processed. 
* **data processor**. An organization that processes personal data at the direction of a data controller. In many cases, a service organization may process personal data for its business-to-business (B2B) customers (user entities), which in turn may function as data controllers. In other cases, a service organization may function as a data controller, depending on the facts and circumstances. 
* **data subject**. The individual about whom personal information is collected. 
* **design**. As used in the COSO definition of internal control, the internal control system design is intended to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of an entity’s objectives. 
* **disclosure**. The provision of access to or the release, transfer, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information. Disclosure is often used interchangeably with the terms sharing and onward transfer. 
* **disposal**. A phase of the data life cycle that pertains to how an entity removes or destroys data or information. 
* **effectiveness (of controls)**. Encompasses both the suitability of the design of controls and the operating effectiveness of controls to provide reasonable assurance that the entity’s principal system objectives are achieved. 
* **endpoint devices**. Connected hardware or virtual devices that communicate across a network, such as mobile devices, laptops, desktops, and sensors. 
* **entity**. A legal entity or management operating model of any size established for a particular purpose. A legal entity may, for example, be a business enterprise, a not-for-profit organization, a government body, or an academic institution. The management operating model may follow product or service lines, divisions, or operating units, with geographic markets providing for further subdivisions or aggregations of performance. 
* **entity-wide**. Activities that apply across the entity — most commonly in relation to entity-wide controls. 
* **environmental**. Of or having to do with the matters that can damage the physical elements of information systems (for example, fire, flood, wind, earthquake, power surges, or power outages). An entity implements controls and other activities to detect, prevent, and manage the risk of casualty damage to the physical elements of the information system from environmental elements. 
* **external users**. Users, other than entity personnel, who are authorized by entity management, customers, or other authorized persons to interact with the entity’s information system. 
* **functional requirements**. Requirements that must be met for the system to correctly fulfill its designed purpose.
* **information and systems**. Refers to information in electronic form (electronic information) during its use, processing, transmission, and storage and systems that use, process, transmit or transfer, and store information or that produce, manufacture, or distribute products. 
* **information assets**. Data and the associated software and infrastructure used to process, transmit, and store information or to produce, manufacture, or distribute products. 
* **infrastructure**. The collection of physical or virtual resources that supports an overall IT environment, including the server, storage, network elements, and endpoint devices. 
* **internal control**. A process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. 
* **nonfunctional requirements**. System attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability that define how well a system will operate.
* **outsourced service providers**. A service provider that performs business processes, operations, or controls on behalf of the entity when such business processes, operations, or controls are necessary to achieve the entity’s objectives. 
* **personal information**. Information that is about, or can be related to, an identifiable individual. 
* **policies**. Management or board member statements of what should be done to effect control. Such statements may be documented, explicitly stated in communications, or implied through actions and decisions. Policies serve as the basis for procedures. 
* **practitioner**. As used in this document, a CPA who performs an examination of controls within an entity’s system relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. 
* **principal system objectives**. System objectives that relate to the trust services category or categories addressed by the examination and that could reasonably be expected to influence the relevant 
decisions of intended users. (See system objectives.) 
privacy commitments. Declarations made by management regarding the performance of a system 
processing personal information. Such commitments can be communicated in written agreements, standardized contracts, service-level agreements, or published statements (for example, a 
privacy practices statement). In addition, privacy commitments may be made on many different 
aspects of the service being provided. 
privacy notice. A written communication by entities that collect personal information, to the individuals about whom personal information is collected, about the entity’s (a) policies regarding 
the nature of the information that they will collect and how that information will be used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of or anonymized and (b) commitment to adhere to those policies. A privacy notice also includes information about such matters as the purpose of collecting 
the information, the choices that individuals have related to their personal information, the security of such information, and how individuals can contact the entity with inquiries, complaints, 
and disputes related to their personal information. When a user entity collects personal information from individuals, it typically provides a privacy notice to those individuals. 
process or control framework. A framework that contains a set of processes or controls, established by another party, that organizations are expected to implement in support of establishing 
an effective system of internal control. These frameworks are usually developed by an industry 
group, regulator, governmental entity, standard-setting body, or other organization (collectively 
referred to as sponsoring organizations) to obtain information from organizations with which 
they do business about their processes and controls. The most common types of process or control frameworks relate to security and privacy. 
products. Tangible or intangible goods manufactured or produced by an entity. Throughout this 
document, the term is used interchangeably with goods.
report users. Intended users of the practitioner’s report in accordance with AT-C section 205, Assertion-Based Examination Engagements.

Page 73 
controls stated in the description, which are necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the 
entity achieved its principal system objectives, were effective based on the applicable trust services criteria. Such an examination is based on guidance contained in AICPA Guide Reporting 
on an Examination of Controls Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy in a Production, Manufacturing, or Distribution System (SOC for Supply 
Chain guide). 
software. A collection of instructions that tell a computer how to operate. Software may be both 
internally developed and purchased from vendors and can include both application software

example, operating systems, drivers, utilities, programming software, and interfaces).
stakeholders. Parties that are affected by the entity, such as shareholders, the communities in which 
an entity operates, employees, customers, and suppliers. 
subsequent events. Events or transactions that occur after the specified period addressed by the description but prior to the date of the practitioner’s report. Such events or transactions could have 
a significant effect on the evaluation of whether the description is presented in accordance with 
the description criteria or whether controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that 
the entity’s principal system objectives were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. 
supplier. See vendor. 
system. Refers to the infrastructure, software, procedures, and data that are designed, implemented, 
and operated by people to achieve one or more of the entity’s specific business objectives (for 
example, delivery of services or production of goods) in accordance with management-specified 
requirements. 
system boundaries. The specific aspects of an entity’s infrastructure, software, people, procedures, 
and data necessary to perform a function (such as producing, manufacturing, or distributing a 
product) or provide a service. When systems for multiple functions or services share aspects, infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data, the systems will overlap, but the boundaries 
of each system will differ. 
system components. Refers to the individual elements of a system, which may be classified into the 
following five categories: infrastructure, software, people, processes, and data. 
system event. An occurrence that could lead to the loss of, or disruption to, operations, services, or 
functions and could result in an entity’s failure to achieve its system objectives. Such an occurrence may arise from actual or attempted unauthorized access or use by internal or external parties and (a) impair (or potentially impair) the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of information or systems; (b) result in unauthorized disclosure or theft of information or other assets or 
the destruction or corruption of data; or (c) cause damage to systems. Such occurrences also may 
arise from the failure of the system to process data as designed or from the loss, corruption, or 
destruction of data used by the system. 
Page 74 
system incident. A system event that requires action on the part of entity management to prevent or 
reduce the impact of the event on the entity’s achievement of its system objectives. 
system objectives. The entity’s objectives, established by entity management, that are embodied in 
the product commitments it makes to customers, including producing or manufacturing a product 
that meets product performance specifications and other production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. The system objectives also include the requirements established for the functioning of the system to meet production, manufacturing, or distribution commitments. 
system requirements. Specifications regarding how the system should function to (a) meet the entity’s commitments to customers and others (such as customers’ customers); (b) meet the entity’s 
commitments to suppliers and business partners; (c) comply with relevant laws and regulations 
and guidelines of industry groups, such as business or trade associations; and (d) achieve other 
entity objectives that are relevant to the trust services category or categories addressed by the 
description. Requirements are often specified in the entity’s system policies and procedures, system design documentation, contracts with customers, and government regulations. 
System requirements may result from the entity’s commitments relating to security, availability, 
processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. For example, a commitment to programmatically 
enforce segregation of duties between data entry and data approval creates system requirements 
regarding user access administration. 
third party. An individual or organization other than the entity and its employees. Third parties may 
be customers, suppliers, business partners, or others. 
threat. Any circumstance or event, arising from human actions or natural events, that could potentially impair (a) the achievement of an entity’s objectives, its assets, or activities of its personnel, 
or (b) other entities through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, or 
denial of service.
trust services. A set of professional attestation and advisory services based on a core set of criteria 
related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. 
unauthorized access. Access to information or system components that (a) has not been approved 
by a person designated to do so by management and (b) compromises segregation of duties, confidentiality commitments, or otherwise increases risks to the information or system components 
beyond the levels approved by management (that is, access is inappropriate). 
vendor (or supplier). An individual or business (and its employees) that is engaged to provide 
goods or services to the entity. Depending on the services provided (for example, if the vendor 
operates certain controls on behalf of the entity that are necessary to achieve the entity’s objectives), it also might be a service provider. 
vulnerability. Weakness in a component of a system, particularly information assets, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation, that could be exploited or triggered by human action or natural events
